## Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>

The main goal of this project is to use the comprehensive CPI dataset to predict monthly stock prices for the S&P 500 index as well as for specific sectors within the index. Using measurements such as monthy % changes, real risk premium, and inflation risk premium alongside inflation predictor variables, we aim to reach an R^2 value of .8 or greater. By aiming for an R^2 we do realize we are giving ourselves some room for error.

## Methodology <a name="meth"></a>

Here is some code that we used to develop our analysis. Blah Blah. [More details are provided in the Appendix](page2).
 
Note that for the purposes of the website, you have to copy this code into the markdown file and  
put the code inside trip backticks with the keyword `python`.

```python
import seaborn as sns 
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris') 

print(iris.head(),  '\n---')
print(iris.tail(),  '\n---')
print(iris.columns, '\n---')
print("The shape is: ",iris.shape, '\n---')
print("Info:",iris.info(), '\n---') # memory usage, name, dtype, and # of non-null obs (--> # of missing obs) per variable
print(iris.describe(), '\n---') # summary stats, and you can customize the list!
print(iris['species'].value_counts()[:10], '\n---')
print(iris['species'].nunique(), '\n---')
```

Notice that the output does NOT show! **You have to copy in figures and tables from the notebooks.**
